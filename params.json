{"name":"David Young's Code","tagline":"","body":"[Tab Flow](https://github.com/davidyoung604/Tab-Flow): The path of least resistance\r\n===================================================================================\r\n\r\n*Tab Flow* is an extension for Google Chrome that allows you to better manage your open tabs.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nGrab it from the Google Chrome store!\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n- Type something into the search box (e.g. youtube) to filter by all tabs that mention \"youtube\"\r\n    - Don't worry about capitalization\r\n- If you want to search by the URL instead of the title, check the box for \"Use URLs\"\r\n- If you click the link of a tab, you'll be redirected to that tab\r\n- Clicking \"Bookmark\" will bookmark the current list of tabs into a new folder on the Bookmark Bar\r\n    - The new folder will have the current date and time to keep things separated\r\n- Clicking \"Move\" will move the current list of tabs to a new window\r\n    - This is handy for keeping work/school/personal life separate\r\n- Clicking \"Close\" will (of course) close the current list of tabs\r\n    - There's no \"Re-Open\" button, so be sure you want to close them\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n- The number on the icon is the number of open tabs you have across all open windows.\r\n- If you find a bug or have a feature request, please post it in the [Issues](https://github.com/davidyoung604/Tab-Flow/issues) section so we can keep things organized.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore projects to come soon!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
